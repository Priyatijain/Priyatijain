# Priyati Jain – Generative AI & Agentic Systems Portfolio

Hi, I’m Priyati Jain.

I am a Generative AI Engineer / Data Scientist with close to 2 years of hands-on experience building enterprise-grade AI and LLM-based systems. I currently work at Tech Mahindra, where I design and develop practical GenAI solutions focused on real business and data problems rather than experimental demos.

My work sits at the intersection of large language models, data engineering, and system design. I primarily work on multi-agent orchestration, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and LLM-driven automation pipelines that operate on structured and unstructured data.

## What I Work On
My day-to-day work involves designing LLM-powered systems where multiple components or agents collaborate to solve complex tasks. This includes:

- Multi-agent workflows using LangGraph, LangChain, and CrewAI  
- Agentic AI systems with clear role separation (reasoning, tool use, validation, decision-making)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for documents, tables, and datasets  
- Vector-based semantic search using embeddings and vector databases  
- Backend integrations using Python and FastAPI  

I place strong emphasis on reliability, structured outputs, and reducing hallucinations so that LLM systems behave predictably in production environments.

## About This Repository
This repository is a portfolio of real-world GenAI system designs and workflows based on my professional experience.
Due to enterprise and client confidentiality, source code cannot be shared publicly. Instead, this repository focuses on:

- System architecture and workflow diagrams  
- Agent roles and orchestration logic  
- High-level implementation details  
- Design decisions and trade-offs  

This reflects how production GenAI systems are typically reviewed and discussed in enterprise settings.

## Projects Covered
The case studies in this repository are based on real enterprise and innovation projects I have worked on. While source code is not shared due to confidentiality, each project is documented with architecture, agent workflows, and design decisions.

### Agentic Analytics Platform (GCash)
Designed an agentic analytics system that allows business users to query data using natural language. The system converts user questions into validated SQL queries, executes them on PostgreSQL, and generates automated business insights along with tables and visualizations. The architecture uses multiple specialized agents for schema understanding, SQL generation, insight reasoning, and visualization selection.

### Google Public DataCommons Integration
Built a schema-driven, multi-agent pipeline to automatically convert raw public datasets into Template MCF (TMCF) and MCF formats required for Google Data Commons ingestion. The system uses LLM-based reasoning to understand dataset structure, classify roles, and generate schema-compliant DCIDs, enabling scalable onboarding into Google’s knowledge graph.

### Cisco Information Extraction System
Developed a large-scale multi-agent information extraction pipeline to identify and validate global parent and legal hierarchy relationships across 6000+ organizations. The system combines web search, crawling, LLM reasoning, and embedding-based confidence scoring to continuously improve data quality and accuracy.

### AI-driven PMO Assistant (IBM Watsonx Hackathon – 2nd Place)
Built a multi-agent project management assistant that ingests project data, detects delays and risks, recalculates schedules, and generates AI-driven mitigation strategies. The solution incorporated human-in-the-loop validation and reduced project planning effort significantly during evaluation.

### Long-term Memory Conversational AI (LangMem)
Implemented a conversational AI system with long-term memory using LangGraph and LangMem. The assistant stores episodic and semantic memories in PostgreSQL-backed vector storage, enabling persistent personalization across sessions instead of stateless conversations.

## Tech Stack

- Designing multi-agent systems with clear role separation and orchestration  
- Implementing agent workflows with reasoning boundaries and tool integration  
- Building memory-aware AI applications using episodic and semantic memory  

### Prompt Engineering & Reasoning
- Structured prompt design using zero-shot, few-shot, instruction-based, and role-based prompting  
- Enforcing deterministic outputs and schema adherence in LLM responses  
- Applying controlled reasoning patterns to reduce hallucinations  

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Designing RAG pipelines for structured and unstructured data sources  
- Using embeddings for semantic search and context retrieval  
- Working with FAISS and PostgreSQL (pgvector) for vector-based similarity search  

### Machine Learning & NLP
- Practical experience with PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face  
- Strong foundation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformers  
- Experience with supervised learning (regression, classification)  
- Exposure to unsupervised learning techniques and representation learning (VAEs)  

### LLM Models & Fine-Tuning Concepts
- Working knowledge of GPT-series, Gemini, LLaMA, and Mistral models  
- Understanding of parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches (LoRA, QLoRA)  
- Awareness of fine-tuning trade-offs and practical deployment constraints  

### Backend, Cloud & Deployment
- Building backend services using FastAPI and REST APIs  
- Integrating LLM platforms such as OpenAI APIs, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI  
- Supporting scalable inference and API-driven GenAI workflows  

### Applied AI & Delivery Practices
- Foundational understanding of CI/CD concepts for ML systems  
- Exposure to LLMOps principles and Model Context Protocol (MCP)  
- Familiarity with Agile/Scrum development workflows  
- Experience building document parsing, OCR-based pipelines, and conversational AI systems  


## Why This Portfolio Exists
This repository is not meant to showcase toy examples. It is intended to demonstrate how I approach GenAI system design, agent orchestration, and real-world AI problem solving in enterprise environments.
If you are interested in agentic AI, LLM system design, or production-ready GenAI applications, this portfolio should give a clear picture of my work and thinking.
